	SearchEngine 20.20
		MAJOR OVERHAUL of the SearchEngine introducing multiprocessing using the ParallelFox package by Joel Leach (https://github.com/VFPX/ParallelFox)
		- unleash the power of your multicore environment: all functions support multiprocessing boosting the speed manyfold
		- script language supports parameters and has new commands
		- improved MetaExport format

		- new logo and icon
		
2020.04.09
	SearchEngine 19.13

	SearchEngine 19.11
		expanded Meta Export format to include information of the relative position within candidates

		you can now specifiy the temporary file directory in Preferences (saved in config.fpw)
		the default file extension can be switched between ".dbf" and ".txt" in Preferences (default = ".txt") with direct effect on file selection dialogs
		implemented tolerance to slight numeric discrepancies caused by the internal representation preventing omitted candidates on the threshold
		
2019.11.14
	SearchEngine 19.00
		removed the requirement for unique keys by allowing record numbers for all exports
		new function Result Export creates filtered subsets and/or samples of the result table to temporarily or permanently replace it

2019.04.25
	SearchEngine 18.12

		adjusted the size of the GroupedExport dialog
		manual is now a separate document
		updated manual and presentation

2018.11.19
	SearchEngine 18.11
		improved internal sorting is faster and supports higher search depths 
		search depth still defaults to 262144 (depth = 0), but allows a maximum of 1048576
		maximum number of words is increased from 1024 to 2048
		if preferences have the default value, they are not displayed in the structure string

2018.08.14
	SearchEngine 18.01
		record number of the seclected entry is now displayed as part of the heuristic information window

2018.05.28
	SearchEngine 18.00
		new cascade parameters: s = score, p = percentile of score (see documentation)
		changes to GroupedExport dialog to accomodate new cascade parameters
		reworked File Locations dialog
		all activities within the GUI are logged to searchengine.log in the searchengine directory as script commands
		batch mode based on SearchEngine script commands (see documentation)
		delivery directory structure changed (SearchEngine files in SE sub-directory)
		introducing special preparer for german firms and street names as plug-in (searchengine.xml)
		
2018.03.27
	SearchEngine 17.12
		bugfix for the mirror option

2017.09.14
	SearchEngine 17.11
		bugfix for research exception
		
2017.08.30
	SearchEngine 17.10
		included the "mirror" option under action to guarantee bi-directional matches (see documentation)
		improved stability for very large base tables
	
2017.06.01
	SearchEngine 17.00
		tab-delimited text file support for "File locations" and all exports
		bugfix regarding the handling of long words in search term
		changed the size of many dialogs
		removed depreciated dialogs "AutoChecker" and "ResultAnalyser"
		new "Browser" dialog in "tools" to peek into Foxpro tables
		exports now allow "Skip if results greate equal the maximum exits" for better export splits
		changed example in GroupedExport dialog
		improved QuickSearch dialog
		removed compatibility with depreciated result table format
		options in the search dialog for overwriting the last run
		option "continue a canceled search" does not increment the run counter
		
	txt2fox
		removed because the SearchEngine now handles text files
		
	fox2txt
		removed because the SearchEngine now handles text files

2017.02.07
	SearchEngine 12.10
		major bugfix regarding the activation and cutoff handling introduced by version 12.01
		
2017.01.19
	SearchEngine 12.02
		minor changes to the wording (properties are now called settings)
		
2017.01.11
	SearchEngine 12.01
		removed a bug in the table cluster handling
		changed the behaviour of "activation"
			when activation kicks in, feedback will be activated as usual
			if a cutoff is specified, the feedback will only be used to internaly rank the results, which will be reported without feedback
		introduced the log option for the SearchTypes (similar to IDF)
			the occurrences of the words are transformed by: log(max_word_occurrence_of_searchtype / occurrence)
			this transformation is similar to the inverse document frequency (IDF) which uses number of documents in the numerator
		changes to the gui
			priorities, offsets and activation of log based weights can now be set within a single form called SearchTypes
			lcrpd scope and depth are moved to a separate form in menu "File"
			"Info" is renamed to "Notes" and moved under the menu point "Tools"

			changed the order of all menu entries according to the natural sequence of a search
			increased default window sizes to accomodate longer path names

		adjusted default search depth to 0, which results in using the maximum search depth
		improved memory usage and performance of grouped export by exchanging FirstPathTable with ClusterPathTable
		improved display of search heuristics for the QuickSearch and the ResultChecker
		Unificator is no longer a part of the Tool menu
