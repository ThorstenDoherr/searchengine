# searchengine
**SearchEngine** is a tool written in Foxpro and to a small but decisive part in C. It implements heuristic matching of large databases by fuzzy criteria like addresses. The fundament of the heuristic is constituted in the registry, a dictionary containing the words of your data along with the occurences. An important word has a low occurrence while filler words have high occurrences. The tool allows to specify weights on your search fields (e.g. firm name, street, city), which, in conjunction with a threshold, define the basic search strategy. This strategy can be further refined by additional options managing weight distributions (log, softmax, offset), defining feedback of surplus words, activation of countermeassures for suspiciously large candidate list and so on. A pertinent search approach consists of multiple search runs. The first run should always be a basic search, defining the overall settings according to the data structure followed by several specialized runs taking the specifics of the data into account, e.g. missing address parts, misspellings, noise in the name field and so on. It is strongly advised to read the paper **HolisticMatching.pdf** and to go through the **searchengine.md** (**searchengine.pdf**) and the presentation slides in the **doc** directory.

The **SE** directory contains the SearchEngine. If you are not interested in the source code, ignore the **code** directory. The **SEML** directory contains STATA scripts for the **SearchEngine Machine Learning** approach to refine your results after matching. If you want to dabble with the SearchEngine, try the test files in the **data** directory. In the **dll** directory, you can find potentially missing DLLs in case the SearchEngine complains at startup.

## Documentation
The documentaion can be found in the  **doc** directory. It consists of a manual, a background paper and presentations explaining the algorithm and major features.

## Prerequisites
Windows

## Getting started
It is recommended to install a Markdown plugin for your browser to read the **doc/searchengine.md** file for installation instructions. Alternatively, read the **doc/searchengine.pdf**.

## Version history
2025.04.30
- improved reactivity of the message bar of the GUI
- fixed a bug where specifying a run filter for a meta data export would cause an error message
- updated manual

2025.04.24
- a new strip action allows to retroactively strip the result table of candidates
  - apply a threshold and cutoff on existing results
  - inverse cutoff strips the results to keep only the best search terms (searched) per candidate (found)
  - stripping can be restricted for specific runs
  - runs can be renumbered

2025.03.19
- included an option to draw weighted samples of the result table
- when exporting meta data, an existing search table registry will be recreated after changes to the base registry

2025.03.03
- the zealous and darwininan settings are also applied after refinement for a more consistent behaviour
- the import functions have been updated to properly separate ID fields with numbers and special characters from real number fields
- in the result browser and quick search heuristics now show the correct feedback effect for search types with log smoothing

2024.09.28
- optimized the contraction of abbreviations with the "NOABBREV" preparer, respectively the underlying "cockle" function
- internally, every index has a designated ".cdx" file, thus "\*\_index\_\#.cdx" files may appear to increase overall file size capacity
- Config>File Locations has a decdicated "Auto" button to generate result table names
- Meta files can now be properly overwritten with the "force" command
- seml_train.do reads all sample files following the template \*sample\*.txt

2024.09.20
- new help system based on searchengine.md in the SE root directoy, which can be opened with a markdown browser plugin
- help command added (enter help("help") in the Command window for help about the new help system)
- you can click on links (in \[brackets\]) in help texts to navigate through the manual
- improved detection of multiprocessing issues (still unconfirmed if will work due to the erratic nature of the issue)
- added preparer related commands to test, browse and load preparers
- changed the Config>Settings dialog to match the "Containment" strategy (see manual)
- new Tool>Statistics dialog and associated "statistics" command
- ctrl+enter can be used in the Command window to executed selected code

2024.06.06
- SearchEngine is using Visual Foxpro Advanced: no 2GB table size limit!!!
- cleaned up SE directory by removing unnecessary libraries (DLLs) to the dll directory (in case Windows complains, this is where you can find the missing libraries)
- ParallelFox 2.0 is now using the parallelfoxa.exe (start SearchEngine.exe as Administrator to install necessary registry entries)
- File->Command window allows to issue script commands and manage script files (marked selections can be executed)
- SearchEngine recognises multiple preparer XMLs in its directory matching the file template searchengine\*.xml 
- reorganised the search call to establish consistency for the last run replacement call
- fixed a bug in the meta export that messed up the candidate count parameter cnt (trailing zeroes were truncated)

2024.01.24
- version number is replaced with compilation date to spare us the obscure number magic
- switch to ParallelFox 2.0 by exchanging parallelfox.vcx and parallelfox.vct to be prepared for VFP Advanced
  hint: the parallelfox class **workerproxy** has been changed to provide easy access to worker number and count: `_screen.worker`, `_screen.workercount`

2023.10.10 SearchEngine 20.23.1
- changed import function for base and search table to always decode utf-8 characters in GUI and script language
