# searchengine
**SearchEngine** is a tool written in Foxpro. It impletements heuristic matching of large databases by fuzzy criteria like addresses.
The fundament of the heuristic is the registry, a dictionary containing the words of your data along with the occurences.
The incremental approach allows for fine-tuning of mutliple search runs to reduce false positives while preventing false negatives.

You can ignore the **code** directory if you are not interested in the source code.


## Prerequisites
Windows

## Getting started
* Copy the **SE** directory in your data directory.
* Start the **SearchEngine.exe** to bring up a graphical user interface.
* Follow the instructions of the manual in the **doc** directory and browse through the slides.
* Your data has to be in tab-delimited text-format with header names und unique keys.
* The **data** directory contains two sample files to train your matching skills.
* You will need a **SE** directory for every dataset constituting the base of a search project.
